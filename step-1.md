# An Intro to JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that runs in the browser. This means that your browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer) can not only read JavaScript files,
but is also able to execute them. A JavaScript file is any text file with a `.js` filename ending and text content which follows the JavaScript language syntax.

In the following section you will learn more about how you can make JavaScript code run in your own browser.

### Running JavaScript directly in your browser

In the following section we will see how we can run JavaScript code directly in our browser. We will not require any text editor as such and we won't need to create any JavaScript files beforehand.
Instead, we will use a **tool** that is pre-installed for us in any browser to write JavaScript and run it subsequently.

#### Exercise: Showing a message box

- Open your browser (Chrome and Firefox are the best options for following this workshop. You can download them here: [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/))
