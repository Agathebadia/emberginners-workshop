# Emberginners workshop

Workshop materials for a day-and-a-half JavaScript beginners workshop teaching JS fundamentals and the basics of building Ember applications.

## How to run

This is essentially a standard Ember app that is built using the Empress project [Training Buddy](https://github.com/empress/training-buddy). Running this locally is the same as running any standard Ember app:

```
cd emberginners-workshop
npm i
npm start
```
