This is a workshop to teach those who have never programmed before (or at least never programmed with JavaScript - the programming language of the web) a few basics in web and JavaScript development. This also includes a short introduction into the JavaScript framework EmberJS which we will use to build our very first web application.

## How to follow the workshop

This workshop and its materials are based on the workshop slides that you can find online at [#url-here](#url-here).
You can follow the slides and go back to previous lessons at any time, either during or after the workshop.

Do you have feedback or improvements for the workshop materials? Talk to us during the workshop and we'd be looking forward to incorporate your suggestion into the next edition of this project.

## What does web development mean?

Learning more about web development allows you to build your own websites and web apps that you can publish online and share with the world! If you ever had the idea for a new project or a tool that can be used online, then this workshop is just for you.

As someone who builds websites and web apps, you're using different technologies or so-called **programming languages**. The main languages used on the web are **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. In the scope of this course we will focus on JavaScript, but if you have interest in learning more about HTML and CSS, we'd like to encourage you to follow your interest. We can also share more materials on these technologies for further learning at the end of the workshop.

With JavaScript as one of the main languages of the web, we can - once we know how to read and write JavaScript code - build our own, interactive web experiences. Many websites nowadays heavily depend on JavaScript to run. These websites which are mainly based on JavaScript programs are also called **single-page applications**. Examples for popular single-page applications online are [gmail.com](https://gmail.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com). Building single-page applications allows us to build modern websites, which feel faster and are more responsive than the traditional websites we are used to from the 90s.

## What is Ember?

Ember is a specific **JavaScript framework** that allows us to build fast single-page applications. As a framework it provides us with a way to write JavaScript code to create our app, but it also provides us with many useful tools to do so. We will learn more about what these tools are about at the workshop.

If you're curious about what you can build with Ember, check out a few of the following websites that are built using it:


- Showcase 1: [Linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/)

##### Exercise: Navigate across directories

Your terminal allows you to navigate through the folders of your computer and create new directories, too. This can be really handy when managing the code files you'll be creating, editing and saving in this workshop.

If you want to create a new folder, you can run `mkdir`, the command for **m** a **k** ing **dir** ectories, followed by the name you'd like to have for that particular folder as a parameter:


```
mkdir my-new-folder
```

This will create an empty folder right where you are in your directory structure. To see what's inside the folder, you can navigate into it and list its content. To do so, you can run the command for navigation as follows:

```
cd my-new-folder
```

And to list the content of the folder, you can run:

```
ls
```

Go ahead and try it:

- Create a new folder called `ember-workshop` with terminal commands
- Navigate into your newly created folder using the terminal
- List the folder's content. What do you see in your shell window?


Did you also know that you can copy-paste any of the commands from this tutorial into your terminal window? Hit Control + C (Windows + Linux) or Cmd + C (Mac) while highlighting the command to copy it and use Control + V (or Cmd + V on Mac) while focussing your terminal window to paste it. This is especially useful for long commands that might take a while to type out.


### Installation (Part 2)

In this part of the installation process, we'll install several tools that are needed for developing our JavaScript application tomorrow. To follow the workshop you will need to install

- Git - a tool for downloading code examples for this workshop
- Node - a JavaScript runtime that comes together with `npm` which helps us to install useful libraries for the application we're building
- Ember CLI - the command line tool we'll be using to run and manage our Ember app

You can install all you need using the [Getting Started Guide for Your Ember Installation](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/).

Feeling stuck and don't know how to continue your installation? Feel free to ask a mentor and/or take a look at what your neighbours are doing!
